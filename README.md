# Quasar Framework PWA App Template
> [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) Starter Kit for a Quasar Framework Project. Compatible with Quasar v0.14+.

Based on the work of Addy Osmani (https://github.com/vuejs-templates/pwa).

> **DEPRECATED FOR v0.15+**

## Usage
Use Quasar CLI to generate a new project using this template:

``` bash
# install Quasar CLI if you don't have it already
$ npm install -g quasar-cli

# generate a project folder with this template
$ quasar init pwa my-project

$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ quasar dev
```

> Important! Do not use Quasar wrappers (Cordova/Electron) on top of this template.

## Documentation

- This template builds on top of the main/default Quasar webpack template.

- Check out the [official Quasar guide](http://quasar-framework.org/guide/) for general information about Quasar that is not specific to this template.

## What's Included

* Service Worker precaching of application shell + static assets (prod)
* Script (async chunk) preloading using `<link rel="preload">`
* Web Application Manifest + favicons

  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint

### Issue Reporting Guidelines

**Please use the appropriate Github repo to report issues. See "Related Components" above.** For example, a bug related to CLI should be reported to the CLI repo, one related to build issues to Quasar Framework Templates repo and so on.

- The issue list of the repository is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. For anything else please use the [Community Forum](http://forum.quasar-framework.org).

- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been fixed in the development branch or it may have a resolution.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Quasar. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.
